##### New Day of My Life
  Today is a new beginning of my life. I've been lost recently.I have no feelings, do not want to do anything at all, do not wanna move, study, sport etc. I just lay down in my bed all day long like a dead fish. It's a hard time to through. But at last, it was past. And I find a new goal in the day. Today, I made a small plan for myself and I will make them come true one by one. I find a small yellow tips notebook for myself and I wrote my little goals into the notebook line by line. When I finished one I will mark a star beside it to ensure that I made it. It's hard for the begining. Like an old Chinese proverb said: 'All beginnings are hard' . I'm so glad that I start a new life from today.I will keep it for a better me.
