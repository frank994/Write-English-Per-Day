### 9.29 Made A Business Plan
I'm a software programmer.
Actually, I do not have any of a high diploma like college even high school. Yes, I do not graduate from high school. I quit my study life when I was a two-grade student in high school. Then I went to a construction site for work. I was to thin to lift these kinds of material for the buildings. Then I quit my work after I work a half of year in there. I don't know why I choose to an IT training school in Beijing. Funny thing is I didn't even know what IT is in that time. Maybe Beijing was the most important cause to push me to study IT. And I spent two years in Beijing to study. Day after day, I thought my life was messed up. Tryna finds a sunshine from the shadows. In the last, I was passed it. The course of IT in Beijing. And there I am, a software programmaer. A front-end engineer. I'm not a master of coding yet. But I used it to earn money to pay the bill for my house. I wanna be a better me. Skillful in coding. Be a master of coding.
