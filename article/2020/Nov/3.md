# November 3th

When I review my life, the funnest thing is, I always keep search what is I don't wanna do in my daily life.
But(there is always has a but), I stay the same. **Habit** is the same, **disadvantage** is same, **laziness** is the same. The only thing changed, is your age. You've been lost a lot of free time.

When you try to beat somebody down, the only obstacle is: whether you have a strong heart, strong enough to make yourself be a warrior.

Guess what, I feel better recently. Not only in life, and work so as.
