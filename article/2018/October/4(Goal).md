### The joyment of photo
I have begun to photo since half a year ago. It is one of my joys in my life. A man has to find some joy in his life, or he will die, is it right? Nobody will say no to the joyful things.
I photoed the people who around me. The relatives, friends, girlfriend.
I was a bad photographer before, and still right now. But I'm beginning to be better at the photo.
I guess I will be good at this and earn some money by this.
I must be good at it.
Soon or later I will be a real photographer.
