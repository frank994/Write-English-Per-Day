### The goal of job
What's the final purpose of the job? To be honest, I don't know. For the money, family responsibility,  or other alternatives? 
I discussed this issue with one of my friends who has been working in a company for a year.
And his answer is: to make job like an interest instead of a tool to earn money. It cleared my brain and my mind like a rainstorm.
I was a man who had a hurried heart to purchase money.
Too naive and too young like a child.
I'm doing what I am doing.
And  I like what am I doing.
Let plan be flexible and changeable.
Then you'll found a rainbow will wait for you in the forward.
