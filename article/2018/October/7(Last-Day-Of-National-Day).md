### 10.7 The last of National Day
Today is the last day of the National Day. And I finished one of my four books. I will have an exam on 21st October. Wish I could pass the exam. 
I strove for the diploma. The college's diploma and the major is English. 
I was a bad student in school. Both middle school and high school. I was being attracted by the electronic games. Like Legend of League or CrossFire Line. Actually, I'm good at them, I once earned money by LOL(Legend of League). I play someone else's role to let them get the high point which let them be proud or could boast.
