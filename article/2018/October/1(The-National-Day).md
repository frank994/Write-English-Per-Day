### The National Day
I am twenty-one years old. I'm in the best year of my life, but I feel stuck. Can't do something that I wanna do. The most important reason is that I lack of money. I earn over 10k per month , I'm a  Front-End Engineer. But I still run out of money every year. I don't know why I can't save some of my salaries every time. Today is the first day of seven long holidays. In China, every October 10th, there is a nationwide seven holidays we called it The Nation Day. It was a long story why it was established. The most important reason is The Chinese Community Party won the inner war and got to rule China.  And the day was 10th October in 1949.
