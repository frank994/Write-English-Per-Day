### I finally got better
I've been through some tough days.

I felt upset all day long those days.

I didn't sleep well, eat well or work well.

I didn't know the reason.

And there must be something wrong with it.

I just can't figure it out.

I talked with somebody in Omegle.
And it did a lot of help to me.
A man who has a good heart talked nearly fifteen minutes with me.
A man that I never saw or met before.
Spend time in me. I really appreciate it.
What's the most important thing in your life?
You need to stand up man.
What you choose is your future not the past.
