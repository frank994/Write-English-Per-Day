### I tryna make myself better
I overslept this morning. Woke up in 6 o'clock, found a truth. That is: no matter what time did I wake up, I always feel sleepy when I read some books.
So I guess I do not need more sleep in the morning. I can get up early and do some exercise like run, skateborad or some other can make me sweat.
It maybe make me alive. It's worth to try.
