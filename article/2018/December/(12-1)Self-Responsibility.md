### Self Responsibility
> What is important for you?
  Is it only important for you or all?
  
  I made a mistake today.
  I got up early and catch up the metro to my sister's home for long live license.
  And I found they were already leave there when I arrived their home.
  And it do let me down. I mean . I spent more than one half hour to transfer the metro and the bus and walk for a while to get there.
  And they weren't home. And in that moment, I relized, you are the only one who cares about you. You own your busisness and you do the responsibility for it.
  You earn the price what birngs to you, and you cost the most of time or value to get it.
  Even thoughl, I still have a good day. I ate a lot of delicous food cooked by my sister's law-in-mother, who is a really nice and kindly person, a traditional Jiangxi province home styled lady.
  Habits make a person, carve a person. 
  All the things that you create for your weakness are unreasonable.
  After all, you did those things that will make you fill lonliness in the end.
