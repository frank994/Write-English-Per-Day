### 9.30 David Bowie's Musics
   This afternoon I found some valuable music made by David Bowie.
It attracted me deeply. Rock & Roll always got a magic power in the world.
The Beatles、Nirvana、The Queen. I like all of them even I wasn't born in that age.  A lot of people say that we were born in the wrong age. We can't even chase them, like go to a concert of one of them. Listen to a live show of them. It was an unrealistic dream to us. John Lennon was dead. The Queen was dead, David Bowie was dead. And a lot of all superstars. It was a huge loss of us, of this world, of the earth. Music can produce superpower by these people.
