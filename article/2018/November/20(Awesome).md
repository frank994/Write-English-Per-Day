### Awesome
There are a lot of people who are better than you.
I met in here, Softbank Robotic Company.
Two gentle HR ladies who always speaks like four languages(If Shanghai accent could treat as a language), Japanese, Chinese, English etc.(Maybe more, I couldn't determine it.)
And me, still is a new fish in this company.
Code every day.
And always give up some thing which I made a decision to do.
As a member of them, this company, this family, a group includes people from mainland(the most), HK(CEO, I guess), Japan(Vice-president), and Taiwan, France...
A wonderful opportunity to me.
I will hold it tightly in my hand.
Thanks Tony gave me that opportunity.
I guess it would change the cycle of my life.
