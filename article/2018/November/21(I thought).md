### I thought
I saw a lot of things in SBRC that I ever never saw before.
What is the style of the IT Senior Engineer?
Nobody could definite it.
Every day do not waste your time.
Make things meaningful and you will feel the happiness.
I guess.
I make a schedule for myself.
morning: cook the breakfast for myself,eat it, read some papers of the English book(I really need study hard about my english. It's terrible.)
Today, I did some components in my work.(Yep, I'm a Front-End Senior Engineer).
But what really confused me is : what is the real purpose that I work hard for?
My family didn't give me many good directions.I travelled  a lot of province in China.
Almost all except Yunnan、Ningxia、Gansu、Henan provinces.
I could felt happiness before, even I didn't have much money. Sometimes I had to strave my stomach or slept in some terrible environment hotel.
And now, I earn a quite of money, over the avage. But I got confused.
