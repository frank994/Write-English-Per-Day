### I arrived in Shanghai

I changed a new style of life.

From Hangzhou to Shanghai.

Which one is better? I couldn't determine it.

I always be a weak person between  a relationship.

Today happened a little sad thing: one of my friends deleted me in QQ. And we got no each others WeChat account. I thought, that is the end of us.

Once you said goodbye to a person, maybe you should be prepared. That is the last meeting with him/her.
I did this to my ex-girlfriend: my littile sprite.

I was a asshole.

I didn't keep my promise in the end.

I hurt her heart, once, twice, thirth.
