### Find my way
I did quit of things today.
First of all. Have a intnet meeting with a group of Frech.It's hard for me.Cause my English is so poor and their accent is so heavily. I couldn't understood every words of their speech.It cause that I can't understood the whole meeting. I felt how weak am I again. Em...I should be spent more time in English than ever.
Second: I found that I always will be attractted by something else when I focused on one thing. Like study or something else. Most of all by other people. Their sounds of foot steps. Their talking voice or some loud voice. I can't focus one thing in one time. 
I do admired my boss, Stanley, who never be troubled by other thing and always deal things with high efficent. Wish I will learn a lot of things from him.
